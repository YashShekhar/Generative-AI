But wait, isn't RSA usually associated with 1024-bit or 2048-bit keys? So 256 might be a bit smaller. Maybe it's referring to the SHA-256 hash function used in the process? Because I know RSA often uses hashing for signing, like in digital signatures.\\n\\nSo putting it together, RSA256 might be an RSA encryption or signature scheme that uses a 256-bit key or perhaps uses SHA-256 for hashing. I'm not entirely sure if it's the key size or the hash function. Maybe I should check that. Oh right, in some cases, RSA with SHA-256 is referred to as RSA-256, where 256 is the hash output size. That makes sense because when creating a digital signature, the hash function is used to create a digest, and then RSA encrypts that with the private key.\\n\\nSo in one sentence, RSA256 would be an RSA-based encryption or digital signature scheme that uses the SHA-256 hash algorithm to create a 256-bit hash, which is then encrypted using RSA. Or maybe it's specifying the key size, but I think it's more about the hash function. \\n\\nWait, but RSA keys are typically larger than 256 bits. 256-bit RSA keys are considered insecure because they can be factored more easily.
